/*!
Rust API for the [Lab Streaming Layer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) (LSL).

The lab streaming layer is a peer-to-peer pub/sub system on the local network that allows for
real-time exchange of multi-channel time series (plus their meta-data) between applications and
machines, with built-in cross-device time synchronization.

The most common use case is in lab spaces to make, e.g., instrument data from different pieces of
hardware (e.g., sensors) accessible in real time to client programs (e.g., experimentation scripts,
recording programs, stream viewers, or live processing software). One of the main features of LSL
is the uniform API that allows clients to read formatted multi-channel data from many device types
(such as EEG, eye tracking, audio, human interface devices, events, etc.) with the same few lines
of code.

The API covers two areas:
- The "push API" (aka publish) allows to create stream outlets and to push data (regular or
  irregular measurement time series, event data, coded audio/video frames, etc.) into them.
- The "pull API" (aka subscribe) allows to create stream inlets and read time-synched experiment
  data from them (for recording, viewing or experiment control).

This crate provides safe bindings to the [liblsl](https://github.com/sccn/liblsl) library via the
low-level/raw `lsl-sys` crate.

**Examples:** this library comes with example scripts for all common use cases (found in the crate's
github repository).

# Errors

Operations that allocate OS resources (e.g., memory, sockets, etc) such as the `new()` functions of
the main objects (`StreamInfo`, `StreamOutlet`, `StreamInlet`, `ContinuousResolver`) may return
`Error::ResourceCreation` variants.

// ==========================
// === Stream Declaration ===
// ==========================

/**
The `StreamInfo` object stores the declaration of a data stream.

It represents the following information:
* stream data format (number of channels, channel format)
* core information (stream name, content type, sampling rate)
* optional meta-data about the stream content (channel labels, measurement units, etc.)

Whenever a program wants to provide a new stream on the lab network it will typically first
create a `StreamInfo` to describe its properties and then construct a `StreamOutlet` with it to
create the stream on the network.

The stream can then be discovered based on any of its meta-data, and recipients who discover the
stream on the network can then query the full stream information.

The content of the `StreamInfo` encompasses all the static information that is known up-front about
a data stream, and therefore, anything you would expect to find in a file header for a streaming
data file should be written into the stream info (in fact, if you use a tool to record one or more
streams into an `XDF` file, the stream info goes into the file header.

**Examples:** this library comes with example scripts for all common use cases (found in the crate's
github repository). You can find various uses of the `StreamInfo` object in most of these files.

    Core stream information is specified here. Any remaining meta-data can be added subsequently.

    Arguments:
    * `stream_name`: Name of the stream. Describes the device (or product series) that this stream
       makes available (for use by programs, experimenters or data analysts). Cannot be empty.
    * `stream_type`: Content type of the stream.
       Please see [here](https://github.com/sccn/xdf/wiki/Meta-Data) (or web search for: XDF
       meta-data) for pre-defined content-type names that LSL adheres to, but you can also make
       up your own. The content type is the preferred way to find streams (as opposed to searching
       by name).
    * `channel_count`: Number of channels per sample. This stays constant for the lifetime of the
       stream.
    * `nominal_srate`: The sampling rate (in Hz) as advertised by the data source, if regular
       (otherwise set to `lsl::IRREGULAR_RATE`).
    * `channel_format`: Format/type of each channel. If your channels have different formats,
       consider supplying multiple streams or use the largest type that can hold them all (such as
       `ChannelFormat::Double64`).
    * `source_id`: Unique identifier of the device or source of the data, if available (such as
       the serial number). This is critical for system robustness since it allows recipients to
       recover from failure even after the serving app, device or computer crashes (just by finding
       a stream with the same source id on the network again). Therefore, it is highly recommended
       to always try to provide whatever information can uniquely identify the data source itself.

/**
Resolve all streams on the network.

This function returns all currently available streams from any outlet on the network.
The network is usually the subnet specified at the local router, but may also include
a multicast group of machines (given that the network supports it), or list of hostnames.
These details may optionally be customized by the experimenter in a configuration file
(see Network Connectivity in the LSL wiki).
This is the default mechanism used by the browsing programs and the recording program.

Arguments:
* `wait_time`: The waiting time for the operation, in seconds, to search for streams. A good value
   is around 1.0 or 2.0 seconds. *Warning*: If this is too short (<0.5s) only a subset (or none) of
   the outlets that are present on the network may be returned.

Returns a `Vec` of `StreamInfo` objects (excluding their desc field), any of which can subsequently
be used to open an inlet. The full info can be retrieved from the inlet if needed.

**Examples: the `receive_*.rs` examples (found in the crate's github repository) illustrate
the use of the resolve functions.

Resolve all streams with a specific value for a given property.

Arguments:

  "source_id", or "desc/manufaturer").
* `value`: The string value that the property should have (e.g., "EEG" as the type property).
* `minimum`: Return at least this number of streams.
* `timeout`: A timeout for the operation, in seconds. If the timeout expires, less than the desired
   number of streams (possibly none) will be returned. To have no timeout you can use the value
   `lsl::FOREVER` here, otherwise use at least 1.0 to 2.0 seconds to allow for results to come in
   on a busy network. *Warning*: If this is too short (<0.5s) only a subset (or none) of the
   outlets that are present on the network may be returned.

Returns a `Vec` of `StreamInfo` objects (excluding their desc field), any of which can subsequently

// ======================
// ==== Stream Inlet ====
// ======================

/**
A stream inlet.
Inlets are used to receive streaming data (and meta-data) from the lab network.

The actual sample-pulling functionality is provided via the `Pullable` trait below.

**Examples:** the `receive_*.rs` examples (found in the crate's github repository) illustrate the
use of `StreamInlet`.

### Errors

For operations where a timeout is provided, if the operation does not complete in time,
an `Error::Timeout` will be returned -- except for the `pull_*()` functions, where this is not
considered an error. Also, for most operations, an `Error::StreamLost` is returned if the stream
source has been lost in the meantime (see also `recover` option in the inlet's `new()` constructor).

    Construct a new stream inlet from a resolved stream info.

    Arguments:
    * `info`: A resolved stream info object (as coming from one of the resolver functions).
       Note: the `StreamInlet` may also be constructed with a manually-constructed `StreamInfo`, if
       the desired channel format and count is already known up-front, but this is strongly
       discouraged and should only ever be done if there is no time to resolve the stream up-front
       (e.g., due to limitations in the client program).
    * `max_buflen`: The maximum amount of data to buffer (in seconds if there is a nominal sampling
       rate, otherwise x100 in samples). Recording applications want to use a fairly large buffer
       size here (a good default would be 360, which corresponds to 6 minutes of data), while
       real-time applications would only buffer as much as they need to perform their next
       calculation (e.g., 1-10).
    * `max_chunklen`: The maximum size, in samples, at which chunks are transmitted (the default
       corresponds to the chunk sizes used by the sender). If specified as 0, the chunk sizes
       preferred by the sender are used. Recording applications can use a generous size here
       (leaving it to the network how to pack things), while real-time applications may want a
       finer (perhaps 1-sample) granularity.
    * `recover`: Try to silently recover lost streams that are recoverable (those that that
       have a `source_id` set). In all other cases (`recover` is `false` or the stream is not
       recoverable) inlet methods may throw a `LostError` if the stream's source is lost (e.g.,
       due to an app or computer crash).

       upper bound on the uncertainty of the time offset. Empirically, 0.2 ms a typical RTT for

// =====================
// ==== XML Element ====
// =====================

/**
A lightweight XML element tree; models the `.desc()` field of `StreamInfo`.

This class can be tought of as a "cursor" in an XML document owned by the `StreamInfo`, which
provides operations for navigating to parent, children and sibling elements, as well as modification
operations for inserting or removing content. Each element has a name and can have multiple named
children or have text content as value; attributes are omitted. Most operations return a node,
which allows you to chain multiple operations. The API is modeled after a subset of pugixml's node
type and is compatible with it. See also [here](https://pugixml.org/docs/manual.html#access) for
additional documentation.

**Note:** operations on non-existent nodes become safe no-ops instead of returning error variants
or crashing. Since in most cases you will be writing data instead of navigating the tree and/or
reading, you will rarely encounter this. You can rely on the `is_valid()` method to check the
validity of the current element.

**Examples:** the `*advanced.rs` examples (found in the crate's github repository) illustrate the
use of `XMLElement` cursors.

**Panics:** any strings passed into this function must be valid UTF8-encoded strings and contain no
intermittent zero bytes (otherwise this will trigger an assertion).
